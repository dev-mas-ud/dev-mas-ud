# Hi, I'm Masud

I'm a Front-End Developer specializing in React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
I build clean, accessible, and high-performance user interfaces that help brands deliver fast, engaging, and scalable web experiences.

In addition to my front-end expertise, I also have solid full-stack skills in Node.js, Express, Python, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.
This enables me to manage projects end-to-end — from designing smooth user interfaces to connecting secure backends.
